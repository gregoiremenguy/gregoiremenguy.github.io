* sources: it contains source code of functions considered
* bin: the binaries of each function from sources

Inside these two directories, you can found two others:
* nopost: functions without postconditions
* post: functions with postconditions

## Virtual machine

Use virtualbox (https://www.virtualbox.org/) to launch the VM.

The user and root password for the virtual machine is: password.

All necessary materials to replay PreCA experiments are given in the VM.
